#The /src/example-submission folder here acts as your ros workspace.

#You should make a new workspace for each task!
#When writing code in a new workspace try to stick to the following filestructure
#└── src
#    └── task2
#         └── <your program files here>


#This workspace includes an example program template you can use to make your own nodes 
#for the given tasks. The node in this example makes the turtle move in a straight line.

#A few bits of advice from my side:

# -> Make sure to commit your work frequently especially after you're done with a task
# -> Do not plagiarize from online resources. This will only hinder your learning.
# -> The use of LLMs and Googling is highly encouraged as long as you fully understand
# 		what you are copying..
